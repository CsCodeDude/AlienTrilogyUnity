Based upon the incredible work happening at https://github.com/Thor110/AlienTrilogyResurrection and https://github.com/CsCodeDude/AlienTrilogyUnity to both byte by byte uncover the details of the game, and to port into Unity.

Huge thanks to both Thor110 and CsCodeDude for their help along the way, along with the work by Bobblen147 initially and the first attempts at source code by Lex Safanov.

This set of scripts and scene file allows you to load the files from an installation and inspect the maps & assets with the hope of uncovering the game's logic system towards a modern engine port of the game.

Screenshots of tool output below.
